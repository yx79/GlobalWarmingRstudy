Intro:
Global warming and climate change are the phenomenon of rising average temperature of Earth climate system. The emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels, such as carbon dioxide, is the main cause of global warming. The impacts of global warming are significant, which include extreme weather like drought, melting of glacier and rising sea levels, and so on. Global warming could be the biggest challenge and threat of human beings. However, some people and politicians refuse to acknowledge the facts and reduce greenhouse emission. Our team are interested in studying this issue as a data scientist, and explore the profound impacts from climate change on our world.
